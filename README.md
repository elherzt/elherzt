# 👋 Hi, I'm Jesús Romero

I'm a software developer with 11+ years of experience building applications using **.NET**, **JavaScript**, and modern frontend technologies, with a focus on **React**. I enjoy working across the full stack, from backend APIs to user interfaces, and I care about clean architecture, performance, and maintainability.

## 💼 What I Do

- Develop scalable backend services using **.NET (Core & Framework)** and **Entity Framework**
- Build modern UIs with **React**, **React Native**, and other frontend frameworks
- Design and optimize relational databases using **SQL Server**, **PostgreSQL**, and similar tools
- Create dashboards and BI solutions with **DevExpress** and related platforms
- Script and automate with **Python** and use AI APIs for smart features
- Work with **Docker**, **CI/CD**, and cloud deployment (Azure, GCP, Vercel, Render)

> 💡 I’m always open to learning new tools and technologies. I’m not tied to specific stacks — I'm passionate about learning.
